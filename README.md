## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

No installation is required. All the necessary libraries are imported as required in the notebook's cells. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

My main motivation or this project was to practice the CRISP-DM process , as well as get more hands on experience with in the basic data science techniques including building linear models and interfering the outcomes. I leveraged the already familiar from the course work Stack Overflow data from 2017 to answer the following use cases (questions):

1. What makes one be satisfied with own career? Does career satisfaction linked to a country where happiness is the highest (according to some other surveys, the happiest people live in Finland).
2. Does career satisfaction correlate with the current job satisfaction and salary? Is salary (compared to the mean within an individual’s country) the leading factor for an individual’s career satisfaction (one would expect this is the case)?
3. How does career satisfaction relate to the formal degree? How well can we predict career satisfaction based on other related to education data and salary of an individual?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook is available here to demonstrate work related to the above questions. The notebook has the above questions outlined as sections and is exploratory in analyzing the data pertaining to them.  Markdown cells were used to provide the necessary level of details and explanations and to explain the purpose of the data analysis flow.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/***).

Credit and my appreciation goes to:

Stack Overflow for making the wealth the data available. The 2017 Survey set is not only encapsulated a very rich data set from the standpoint of business research, but also provide the opportunity to work with different types of data to sharpen one’s programming skills.

Udacity "Introduction to Data Science" course work materials that provide great insights into the data science techniques as well instrumental code samples code samples. I leveraged some in my project (referenced in comments).
